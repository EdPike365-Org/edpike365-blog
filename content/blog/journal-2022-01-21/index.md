### Summary

This week I'm mostly playing with Docker, [DevContainers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers), Kubernetes. I created a VSCode Docker [Dev Container for Gatsbyjs 3](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/edpike365/gatsbyjs-devcontainer) and published it to Docker Hub.
