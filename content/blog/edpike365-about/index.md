### Me <a name="me"></a>

I am a full stack web apps developer who has largely moved to being a
DevOps engineer. I took some detours from software development into
secondary school science and technology education. I enjoy educating and
mentoring, and it was a good fit for raising five school age children. I
also spent several years taking full time care of my children when my
spouse's medical career became very demanding and we were stationed
cross country with the National Health Service.

My twins just graduated from high school and I'm ready to re-enter the
market. I took advantage of my time off to explore technologies that I
was too busy to explore while working full-time and my new employers
will benefit from that.

### My Goals <a name="goals"></a>

I have a blog entry about my [Professional Goals](/professional-goals).

Here they are in a nutshell:

- Strategic Goals Re-enter DevOps Engineering. Focusing on:

  - DevSecOps: become more focused on security
  - Cloud Engineer: multicloud, but AWS primary
  - [Infrastructure as Software](https://www.pulumi.com/what-is/what-is-infrastructure-as-software/), _not_ code.
  - MLOps: ML, data pipelines
  - Synthetic Biology Cloud Lab Automation: IOT, event driven architecture

- Tactical Goals to support strategic goals:

  - Get job in AWS Shop, preferably consulting.
  - Enhance Python skills. Use Python for most things. Use Go/Rust for
    performance, typically Lambdas.
  - Kubernetes to support multicloud, which supports freedom from vendor
    lock. Kubernetes certs.
  - Imrove Techs: Terraform, Ansible, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Go,
    Django, FastAPI, Okta, AWS Lambda...

### This Site's Technology <a name="site"></a>

I wrote this site in [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). I
wanted to learn a lot about React, JAM Stack, CSS in JS, and NPM
publishing.

I am documenting my work and what I learned in my [Site Customization Journal]/edpike365-customizations/).
