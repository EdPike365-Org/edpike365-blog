## Overall Mission

- Improve IT spend efficiency using automation and data collection, enabling [FinOps](https://www.finops.org/introduction/what-is-finops/) tools required to make decisions about cost vs. value, TCO, and ROI.
- Ease movement of assets between cloud vendors, or on prem (Repatriation):
  - automate infrastructure asset management with vendor neutral tools (IaC)
  - create local/co-hosted cloud infrastructure
- Facilitate problem solving with observability and tracing (Open Telemetry)
- Protect data, IP and other assets with end to end, zero trust security (DevSecOps)
  - Carefully implement AI tools while protecting private internal data
- Increase software dev velocity and quality:
  - Provide self serve, automated, sand-boxed, and transient resources for test and dev (Platform Engineering)
  - Coordinate interops with clear standards (OpenAPI, Message Bus)
  - Add automated test coverage and linting to build processes; gather and present status on dashboards
- Spread the good news about DevOps.

## Tactics

I focused on the tech below to support my career goals. I have additional long term skills on the backburner: DevSecOps, MLOps, DataOps, IoT Edge Ops

#### DevOps

- Jenkins with Docker and Kubernetes
- GitHub Actions
- Maven, Gradle
- [SonarQube](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/) (code quality)
- DevSecOps
  - Supply Chain, SBOM (Software Bill of Materials), [zero trust](https://about.gitlab.com/blog/2022/08/17/why-devops-and-zero-trust-go-together/)
  - AquaSec [Trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy) (image scans)
  - Kubernetes Security:  AquaSec [kube-bench](https://github.com/aquasecurity/kube-bench) (CIS benchmarks), [AppArmor](https://gitlab.com/apparmor/apparmor/-/wikis/Documentation), [Falco](https://falco.org/docs/)(threat detection), Seccomp Syscalls (Restrict Syscalls)

#### Ops, SRE, Cloud Engineering

- IAC: Terraform (Infrastructure), Ansible (Config)
- AWS: I'm open to other public clouds but I chose AWS as the first one because its the biggest.
- Kubernetes: I have ALL the certs. I can use K8s accross clouds and on prem.
- Monitoring: Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, Grafana

#### Full Stack Web Apps

- Web apps for all the *Ops, DevEx, SRE, etc.
- FrontEnds:
  - Intranet/Extranet CRUD forms: Vanilla HTML, JS, CSS, JQuery, AJAX, SSO
  - Intranet/Extranet docs: Gatsby, with SSR and GraphQL, Emotion CSS
  - Chrome Lighthouse Performance, A11y, mobile first, responsive
- Backend Rest APIs:
  - Java Backend: Leveraging my previous experience (below) and using the exciting new Java stack: Java 11+, Quarkus, GraalVM
  - I know enough Node and Python to use those for REST if needed.
